# nanocyber.git — Nanocyber Research Portal  
*By Doctor0Nano & Perplexity Labs Inc.*

## Overview  
The nanocyber.git research portal serves as the collaborative hub for cutting-edge nanoswarm and nanocybernetic system research and development. This platform integrates multidisciplinary expertise across nanotechnology, cyber-physical systems, AI-driven control, biomedical engineering, and regulatory compliance to realize real-world implementations of nanoswarm therapeutics and digital twin simulations.

## Mission  
We aim to pioneer validated, scalable nanoswarm therapy modeling, neural circuit targeting, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration strategies, leveraging advanced technologies such as:
- Surface-functionalized nanoswarms engineered for receptor-mediated BBB crossing  
- AI-enabled swarm intelligence with closed-loop digital twin architectures in Unreal Engine 5  
- Quantum-assisted compliance and cryptographic transaction traceability via the Googolswarm.os environment

## Key Features & Capabilities  
### Biological & Pharmacokinetic Modeling  
- Mechanistic simulation of receptor-mediated transcytosis and BBB transport pathways (e.g., ApoE, transferrin, GLUT1) with tunable particle morphology and chemistry  
- Integration of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for biodistribution, clearance, and toxicity assessment, informed by primate and rodent datasets  
- Dose-response toxicity prediction anchored in cytokine-mediated vagal nerve activation models  

### Neural Circuit Modulation  
- Magnetically and optogenetically controlled nanoswarms allowing high-precision neuromodulation with spatial resolution below 200 microns in addiction-relevant brain regions  
- Data-driven mapping and targeting of nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) circuits, incorporating real-time feedback from on-board sensors and biohybrid interfaces  

### Digital Twin & AI-Enhanced Control  
- Development of bidirectional digital twins within Unreal Engine 5 for real-time closed-loop simulation of nanoswarm behavior coupled with AI agent control via low-latency MCP server protocols  
- Dynamic adaptive swarm algorithms capable of responding to neural activity patterns using reinforcement learning and superintelligent policy frameworks  

### Compliance, Security & Auditing  
- Implementation of multi-layered compliance protocols including KYC, DID verification, and ALN-enforced real-time transaction risk scoring by quantum processing units (QPU)  
- Cryptographically signed, blockchain-anchored audit trails for all research operations, transaction records, and AI decision flows ensuring complete traceability and legal enforceability  
- Policy-driven operational constraints enforcing maximal safe token usage and blocking unsafe or ambiguous system actions  

## Use Cases  
- Facilitating translational research bridging preclinical nanoswarm therapies to clinical trials using interoperable pharmacokinetic simulations  
- Building regulatory-compliant environments for research and deployment of therapeutic nanoswarms targeting brain disorders involving addiction and neurodegeneration  
- Enabling collaborative, auditable platforms allowing secure multi-party contribution to nanomedicine development and AI system evolution
